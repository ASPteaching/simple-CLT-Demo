# simple-CLT-Demo

This simple app can be used to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem when sampling is performed from different distributions

The app has been adapted from the one created by Nicole Radziwill, 
described [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/12/my-second-r-shiny-app-sampling-distributions-clt/)

It has been improved so that every distribution comes with its default parameter number and with some 
reasonable default parameter values, that can be adaped for the simulations.

As with her previous app:

  - Samples from 9 different statistical distributions are available
  - Four different plot will be created based on 10.000 simulated random samples.
